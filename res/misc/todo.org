Need to store transaction
* NICE-TO-HAVE Allow up to a fixed number of teams
* NICE-TO-HAVE Only allow leaving Jail when close to Jail
Currently a team leaves Jail when the sync endpoint is called and the time is
up. This could also happen outside of the boundaries of Jail.

Easy solution is to add a query parameter with the site to the sync
endpoint. Then if the team is in a site, the token of the site is passed as
value of the query parameter.
* NICE-TO-HAVE Withdraw money when team doesn't move
